	<body>Provides the classes to create a TCP / UDP socket server that communicates using custom serialized Java messages objects.  		 		 		 		 		 		
		<p> The Request Socket Server involves one requirement to function: user classes implementing {@link org.codemonkey.swiftsocketserver.ClientMessageToServer} and {@link org.codemonkey.swiftsocketserver.ServerMessageToClient} to register self-encoding/decoding Java message objects with the server. 		 		 		
		</p>		 		 		
		<p>Note that the server mode (TCP / UDP) doesn't change how the user interacts with the server: the type of transport is managed by the server without breaking API.
